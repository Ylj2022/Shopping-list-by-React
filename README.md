## Shopping List by React

This project is made by React when learning along with the [React Front To Back](https://www.traversymedia.com/Modern-React-Front-To-Back-Course) by Traversy Media. It is similar to the [Shopping List project by JavaScript](https://jennyying-shoppinglist-js.netlify.app/) I made.

Different components are created in the folder of _components_.

It is avaible to add items to the list by entering item in the input and click on the button `+ Add Item`, but currently only on DOM. After reloading the page, it is still the solid example data.

If there is no item entered, there will be an alert.

It is avaible to delete items by clicking the red cross button in the list, but currently only on DOM.

When clicking the red cross, there is a confirmation to pop up.

Click `Clear All` button, the confirmation will pop up and all items will be cleared by choosing `OK`.

When adding items, id is created to each item by using `uuid`: `npm i uuid`

React icons are intalled and some icons are imported: `npm i react-icons`

Other functions need to be added in future.
